    <description homepage="http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/">JAMA is a basic linear algebra package for Java. It provides
  user-level classes for constructing and manipulating real, dense matrices.
  It is meant to provide sufficient functionality for routine problems,
  packaged in a way that is natural and understandable to
  non-experts.</description>
