**The README describes steps we made to build English voice using [MaryTTS][1].**

Slides for seminar can be found [here][5]. This report can be used as a guidline to build your own voice.

For those who just want to get it Fraser's voice up&running, do the following:

1. `git clone https://github.com/YauhenMinsk/voicebuilding_seminar_16.git`
2. run `./gradlew legacyInit` (~3-6 min on a modern laptop 8Gb RAM). If you got BUILD SUCCESS, do the next item.
3. run the `./gradlew run` (~10-13 min on the same env). Wait until you see something like the following

```
016-05-04 10:33:58,054 [main] INFO  marytts.main Startup complete.
 started in 3.432 s on port 59125

### What is under the hood?
First of all, a !audio[ sample ]( https://www.dropbox.com/home/voicebuilding-2016/group2/processed%20data/wav?preview=arctic_a0001.wav ){  size=10 duration=4 }

First of all, let's have a look at the 

Things we did:
Installed marytts
Compiled a list of ‘arctic’ prompts
Recorded Fraser speaking 
Manually removed certain segments using MIDI channel (Praat, skipping repetitions and badly recorded sentences), 893 utterances in the end

Segmented voice using beeps (Created a WAV file for every valid segment using a praat script)
Sync filenames between WAV and TXT files using a python script (as a preparation for MAUS)
Fed the WAV and TXT files into MAUS, got output (alignment?) from MAUS
Turned the resulting TextGrid files into label files using a praat script



Used a voice template (gradle script) to build a voice using the WAV, TXT and LAB files (report problem with en_GB segmentation, thus we switched to en_US and run the MAUS part again)  -> Resegmented the data using American English
Changed the phoneme labels given by MAUS to match the ones read by marytts using a python script
Used ./gradlew run command to run a MaryTTS instance with the new language
Note, that to be able to build everything praat should be installed (for MacOS find solution here)

After processing the audio, we had one large TextGrid file, which contained one important tier: The intervals of the beeps denoting the split between each utterance. Each beep had two boundaries on the TextGrid. Every other section was labeled as “voice”, and the other as “silent”. The short segment during the beep had the “silent” label. Labels which weren’t “voice” were ignored later. This includes the manually annotated errors - any “voice” labels for problematic sentences were removed.

The script to get files is provided here
In order to build our voice using MaryTTS, we needed three directories containing the following:
A list of .txt files, each containing the words read out by the speaker
A list of .wav files, each containing the audio of each utterance
A list of .lab files, a special type of specification for each utterance which lists the end times of each phoneme and their appropriate SAMPA label

We obtained the first of these using a python script. We somehow got a TextGrid tier which had one boundary and a label for each utterance

We obtained the .wav files using a praat script found here:

The important part of the script is this part:

```praat
for interval from start_from to end_at
	select TextGrid 'gridname$'
	intname$ = ""
	intname$ = Get label of interval... tier interval
	intervalstart = Get starting point... tier interval
	if intervalstart > margin
		intervalstart = intervalstart - margin
	else
		intervalstart = 0
	endif
	intervalend = Get end point... tier interval
	if intervalend < endoffile - margin
		intervalend = intervalend + margin
	else
		intervalend = endoffile
	endif
	select LongSound 'soundname$'
	Extract part... intervalstart intervalend no
	filename$ = intname$
	intervalfile$ = "'folder$'" + "'prefix$'" + "'filename$'" + "'suffix$'" + ".wav"
	indexnumber = 0
	while fileReadable (intervalfile$)
	indexnumber = indexnumber + 1
		intervalfile$ = "'folder$'" + "'prefix$'" + "'filename$'" + "'suffix$''indexnumber'" + ".wav"
	endwhile
	Write to WAV file... 'intervalfile$'
	Remove
endfor
```
This part loops through each utterance and calculates its beginning and ending times, and writes them to a .wav file using the label on a separate tier (NOTE: FIGURE OUT WHICH TIER WAS WHICH). After each sound object is created, and written to file, it is then deleted, in order to save space.

With the sound opened as a LongSound object, and the TextGrid with all the utterances labeled after the names of the arctic prompts, we were able to execute the praat script. The script filled the /wav directory with .wav files named after each prompt. The segmenter that we used afterwards required that each .wav file and .txt file had the same names. In order to check that each file aligned with one another, we listened to a few of the audio files and checked to see if the text file matched. Two or three files caused the files to be misaligned, due to oversights in our manual check for errors. We went back, removed these examples, and reran the scripts, and then had our aligned data.

The /wav and /txt directories served as input into the Munich Automatic Segmenter System (MAUS).

This is an external software that we used to help generate the .lab files. Using a .txt file containing the words that were said in the corresponding .wav file, the segmenter generates a TextGrid file with intervals for each phoneme and their label, based on what the system’s speech recognition system could hear. We used the web interface to upload 100 files at a time, until we had 892 TextGrid files containing every phoneme from each utterance.

We used a simple praat script to convert the TextGrid files into label files:

```praat
select Strings listOfFiles
numberOfFiles = Get number of strings
for index to numberOfFiles
	select Strings listOfFiles
	filename$ = Get string... index
	Read from file... 'filename$'
	newobject = Extract tier... 1
	Save as Xwaves label file... text/'filename$'
	Remove
endfor
```
The script loops through each TextGrid file by referring to a Strings object in praat. The String object is just a list of filenames gotten from the arctic prompts. From this the script can open the relevant TextGrid file, extract the useful tier containing the phonemic information, and save it as a label file with an equivalent filename.

At this point we had the /wav, /txt and /lab files, and were ready to build the voice.

The voice was built using the "voice-template" project provided by the lecturer (https://github.com/psibre/voice-template). This template project relies on the "de.dfki.mary.voicebuilding-legacy" plugin in order to process the /wav, /txt and /lab files and make them available for MaryTTS. 

The project's build.gradle file was configured with a "voice" object, initially to a british male speaker. It was then built using the "gradlew assemble" command. During this first compilation attempt divergences emerged between the SAMPA notations used by MaryTTS and MAUS, resulting in the compilation failing.

When the lab files were being translated we identified an issue on MaryTTS. Despite its theoretical support for British English (en_GB), the list of valid allophones was a copy of the American English (en_US) one, i.e., allophones specific to the British pronounciation were not available, rendering the file translation impossible.

Due to this issue, the /wav and /txt files were once again segmented with MAUS, this time using American English, and praat was again used to convert the resulting TextGrid files into \lab ones.

After the files were converted, the "voice-template" project was adapted, in order to use American English, and the build process was executed. In this second compilation attempt, divergences between the notations used by MaryTTS and MAUS emerged once again, this time however, it was possible to map the phonetic symbols to suit MaryTTS.

In order to translate the symbols used by MAUS to symbols recognized by MaryTTS a python script was written:

```python
import sys
from os import listdir
from os.path import isfile, join

symbols = [
	['i:','i'], ['u:','u'], ['aI','AI'], ['3`','r='], ['eI','EI'],
	['<p:>','_'], ['?' ,'_'], ['O:','O'], ['R' ,'r'], ['Q','A'], ['h-','h'],
	['6','r='], ['4','d'], ['I@','I'], ['<usb>','_'], ['m=','r'], ['l=','l'],
	['n=','n'], ['a:', 'a'], ['a', 'A'], ['o:', 'O'], ['y:', 'I'], ['e', 'E'],
	['e:', 'E'], ['E:', 'E'], ['OY', 'OI'], ['y', 'I'], ['o', 'O'], ['9', 'V'],
	['x', 'k'], ['C', 'S'], ['Y', 'I'], ['2:', 'r='] ]

labDirectory = sys.argv[1]
outputDirectory = sys.argv[2]

labFiles = [f for f in listdir(labDirectory) if isfile(join(labDirectory, f))]
labFiles.sort()

for lab in labFiles:
	print('Processing file %s' % lab)
	newFileName = join(outputDirectory, lab)
	f = open(join(labDirectory, lab), 'r')
	content = f.readlines()

	i = 0
	while i < len(content):
    	for symbol in symbols:
        	originalSymbol = symbol[0]
        	correctSymbol = symbol[1]
        	content[i] = content[i].replace(originalSymbol + '\n', correctSymbol + '\n')

    	i += 1
	f.close()
	f = open(newFileName, 'w')
	f.writelines(content)
	f.close()
```

This script receives two command line parameters: an input directory, where the original /lab files are stored, and an output directory, where the new files will be stored. It then loads each file from the output directory, replaces the invalid symbols and saves a new file in the output directory.

The new files were used on the "voice-template" project and the "gradlew assemble" command was executed. This time the project was correctly built and the new voice was ready to be used. 

To test the newly built voice the command "gradlew run" was used and some random text segments were extracted from british (www.theguardian.co.uk) and american (www.cnn.com) news websites.
